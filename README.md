I have developed this project using Typescript.

Here I enter the Github username of a user and i get the details of top 5 repositories of that user.

These repositories are ranked according to the number of forks being done on them.

GITHUB command line project

npm start SanthoshVeera

The above is the command to fetch the details of the SanthoshVeera user and his Github details are being printed in the console.
